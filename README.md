# 8-Puzzle Solver

By Tyson Loveless

## Overview:

This project implements a solver for the 8-puzzle using uniform cost search and A\* search with Manhattan Distance and Misplaced Tiles heuristics. The algorithms have been generalized to solve larger puzzles of the same time (15-puzzle, 24-puzzle, etc.), and the user interface allows solving 15- and 24-puzzles.  Implementation for larger puzzles is trivial if you desire.


## User Guide:

Clone the repo and launch `python eight_puzzle.py` and follow the user interface to build and solve a puzzle of your choosing or solve a default puzzle.

## Consulted works:

- Lecture slides from http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/205/
- Solvability rules from https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/teaching/modules04/java2/TilesSolvability.html
- Various online resources for generating test puzzles.

## Known Issues:
None
